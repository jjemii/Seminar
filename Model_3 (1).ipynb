The Law to Eliminate Discrimination against People with Disabilities is the first action by the Japanese Government to align its domestic laws with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Clarity on the exact definition of what constitutes discrimination is being sought by rights advocates, with the government responding by setting up standards databases and regional councils for resolving disputes.

TerraForm Global is claiming that SunEdison used money allocated for projects in India to improve its own balance sheet. In 2015, the yieldco paid $231m to its parent for a portfolio of Indian projects, with the expectation that SunEdison would use the funds to complete the work and subsequently transfer the plants to TerraForm Global. In the second filing, DE Shaw and Madison Dearborn, acting on concerns that SunEdison will go bankrupt, have launched a lawsuit against SunEdison and its other yieldco, TerraForm Power, insisting that the companies owe them $231m as part of SunEdison $2.4bn acquisition of First Wind Holdings from January 2015. \r\n",

            " UK broadband bills are likely to rise, according to digital minister Matt Hancock, cited in the Telegraph, after the Government proposed that BT be allowed to include the costs of providing internet service to millions of rural Britons in its wholesale prices. Sky and TalkTalk are putting pressure on Ofcom to cut prices further based on claims of excessive profits made by Openreach. TalkTalk has called for the creation of a joint industry fund to pay for rural costs, which it says should be considered separately. BT and Virgin Media suggest strict proposals will curb investment in rolling out ultra-fast fibre optics. Mr Hancock said: “I’m keen to see the right incentives for investment in full fibre.”\r\n",

Some, such as London’s Battersea Place, offer a car pool service as well as a chauffeur, while at Barratt Homes development Fulham Riverside in south-west London, a year's free membership of a car pool scheme is included. In Cambridge, housebuilder Hill is offering a £50 driving credit for a Zipcar scheme close to its Magna development, and even 18th-century Woolley House in Dorset comes with a solar-powered car charging point.\r\n",

The WeWork name has become ubiquitous with co-working, giving the company a massive advantage, he said. However, he said it is hard to see how being better known, having better designed offices, free beer and more chic décor than the competition translates to a value ten times greater than IWG. WeWork claims its builders are a “global physical platform” providing valuable sources of data that is used to power a range of other services and value-added products, which are expected to provide higher margin incremental cash flow.\r\n",
